# Inventory Management

Inventory management is a common logistical challenge for many organisations.
Keeping "spares" can make an organisation more resilient to sudden changes
  in the market.
  
Types of spares include

* **Consumable** spares

  * Low cost and low lead time

* **Repairable** spares

  * Variable cost and variable lead time
  
* **Strategic** spares

  * High cost, typically bought for life (insurance)
  
The lead time is of high importance as only ordering when there are no spares
  will lead to sporadic stocks.
Conversely, stocking up too frequently can drive up storage costs.

As with maintenance, we need to understand these assets to enforce cost-risk
  optimisation.
