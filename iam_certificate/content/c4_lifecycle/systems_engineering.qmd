# Systems Engineering

At some point, any organisation will have to create new assets.
Such a decision carries inherent benefits, costs and risks and therefore must
  be managed correctly.
  
The conceptual model used here is the systems engineering "V" process
  (based on EN50126 RAMS, to be defined later) as shown in @fig-syseng.
The shape of the model should convey how each testing step has an associated
  planning step and vice versa.
Note that other versions exist with more domain-specific steps but the message
  is consistent.

As project time increases, we observe the project size increases as more plans
  and actions are taken.

1. Requirements are clearly defined by the organisation (**PLAN**)

2. Producing a scope and clear plan for the asset (**PLAN**)

3. Design for the system is outlined first (**DO**)

4. A more detailed design is then created (**DO**)

5. The system is implemented according to the plan (**DO**)

    * Implementation strategies are key here, staged roll-out? trial run?
  
At the bottom of the "V", the system is installed but we must validate the
  implementation.
  
6. Isolated testing takes place (**CHECK**)

    * Early testing could be at suppliers' factory, in-house storage
  
    * Detail can be high-level (does it work?) or even component-level
    
7. Functional testing takes place (**CHECK**)

    * Does it work with our system?
  
    * Can it functionally act as the organisation requires?
  
8. Performance testing takes (**CHECK**)

    * Is the entire system working to the standard initially specified?
  
9. Finally, we can implement the system with further monitoring (**ACT**)

Testing is never exhaustive and the monitoring of an existing system should be
  done to correct course as soon as possible.
One such technique is [FRACAS][wiki_fracas].

## RAMS

The four principles @fig-syseng aims to capture are

* **Reliability**
  
  * Probability an asset can perform over a specific time period

* **Availability**

  * Amount of time an asset can be used to fulfil a purpose

* **Maintainability**

  * Probability an asset can be maintained over a specific time period

* **Safety**

  * Probability an asset can perform function without endangering others

Note that

* Reliability is linked to "Mean Time between Failures" (MTBF).
  Longer is better.

* Maintainability is linked to "Mean Time to Repair" (MTTR).
  Shorter is better.
