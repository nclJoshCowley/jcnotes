# Failure Modes

Task selection and Rule-Based Task Allocation (RBTA) classifies failure modes
  into the following categories, then assigns tasks based on each.
  
* **Prevention - Failure (P-F)**

  * Predictable failure based on deteriorating asset condition
  
  * **Task**? Condition-based

* **Usage-Related**

  * Failure caused by usage of the asset
  
  * **Task**? Preventative maintenance

* **Hidden**

  * Root-cause is hidden
  
  * **Task**? Failure-finding

* **Not influenced by maintenance**

  * For example, third-party damage

  * **Task**? Redesign

## Optimum Maintenance Level

Recall the terms

* Operating Expenditure (OpEx)

* Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

* Total Expenditure (TotEx)

![Optimal Maintenance Level (Source <https://coastapp.com/blog/preventive-maintenance/>)](../../images/optimal_maintenance.avif){#fig-optimal_maintenance}

@fig-optimal_maintenance shows the relationship between each expenditure and
  maintenance frequency.
For our purpose, "Prevention Cost" is CapEx and "Repair Cost" is OpEx.

What is typically observed is that having no maintenance correlates with
  high CapEx spending as assets are replaced instead of maintained.
Alternatively, too frequent maintenance leads to high OpEx costs and likely
  wasted efforts.
  
Instead, our goal is to minimise TotEx at the optimum point shown.
Due to other contextual information such as budgets and business environments,
  we may settle for a sub-optimal frequency, but this would need justifying.

## Work Planning

Maintenance should be included in the business case for the new asset.
As with many AM approaches, the plan should be continually improved to
  help make the implementation better.

An advanced plan would include resource planning, missed maintenance guidance
  and constant feedback and review.
  
For example, missing 1 monthly maintenance activity per year (on accident) may
  show no difference to the initial plan of 12 per year.
Such information is a clear opportunity to reduce work and costs with little
  change in risk.

Work planning typically involves

* Resource prioritisation

* Planning processes

* Health and safety

* [*Inventory management*](inventory.html)

* Resource allocation
