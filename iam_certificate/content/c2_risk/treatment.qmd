# Risk Treatment

We can classify the **four** types of risk treatments in the following way
  
* **Treat** (Reduce Likelihood).
  
  * Apply mitigations to minimise risk value

* **Terminate** (Eliminate Likelihood).
  
  * Close down operations to avoid overly high-risk

* **Transfer** (Reduce Consequence).
  
  * Move responsibility to a third-party (outsourcing)

* **Tolerate** (Accept Consequence)
  
  * Accept that the risk sits within the *risk appetite* bounds

For physical assets, we can maintain, replace, refurbish and more to improve
  the asset base.
These actions are called risk controls or risk mitigations.

We will revisit the concept of risk throughout later modules as it is relevant
  to *Whole Life Cost Modelling* and *Risk-Based Maintenance*.
