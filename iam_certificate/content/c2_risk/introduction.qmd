# Introduction

## What is Risk Management?

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition
**Risk** is the effect of uncertainty on objectives.
:::

As a guideline, we can use the ISO 31000 guidelines.
There are three main sections we are interested in for the IAM certification
  that are summarised in three diagrams in @fig-iso31k
  
![ISO 31000:2018. One diagram per clause](../../images/iso31k.png){#fig-iso31k}

* Principles (Clause 4). *Value Creation and Protection*

  * Integrated continual improvement
  
  * Structured yet dynamic
  
  * Comprehensive with all factors (human, cultural, economic, etc.)
  
  * Understand risks with best available information
  
* Frameworks (Clause 5). *Leadership and Commitment*

  * See "Plan-Do-Check-Act"
  
  * Design $\implies$ Implementation $\implies$ Evaluation $\implies$
    Improvement and Integration

* Process (Clause 6)

  * We could interpret this diagram as top-down where scope is defined first
  
  * Constant review throughout with communications, monitoring and recording
  
  * [*Risk assessment*](assessment.html) is the need to identify, analyse
    and evaluate risks
    
  * [*Risk treatment*](treatment.html) is action taken on understood risk.
    Is it acceptable? Can it be mitigated?
