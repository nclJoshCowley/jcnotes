# Contingency

::: {.callout-note}
## Definition
A **contingency** is a future event that is possible, but can't be predicted
  with certainty.
:::

The term is often used in the context of *contingency planning* where we must
  train and plan how to react when the unexpected happens.
The "unexpected" may be a fault that has to be routed around or a
  catastrophic event that requires first responders.

Contingency planning can be broken into three main steps:

1. Understanding risks and potential contingencies

1. Analyse each and prepare standardised responses

1. Prepare for contingent situations (training exercises)

## Readiness 

We evaluate and improve these plans using the Nertney Wheel.

* **Plant**. Is required equipment fit and proper?

* **People**. Are required individuals known and prepared?

* **Procedures**. Are unambiguous plans documented and ready for use?
