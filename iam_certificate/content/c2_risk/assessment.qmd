# Risk Assessment

## Identification

We can identify risks using formal or informal methods.
For example, a Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) where experience
  individuals attempt to exhaustively list all potential hazards.
  
In either case, identifying risks should be systematic, well-defined and
  linked to objectives.

To further discern risks from opportunities, we can use tree analysis
  (event A leads to event B and so on) for before and after the event.
This analysis is commonly called the Bow-Tie Method and can help with
  identifying risks and their preventions, mitigations and consequences.
@fig-risk_bowtie shows an example of this.

## Analysis

Once the risk are identified, we want to understand

* Why the risk event may happen? Is this a symptom of another risk?

* How frequently could this happen?

* What are the potential consequences?

This can be done with informal methods such as discussion and recording;
  as with identification, the bow-tie method may help here.
Or a more formal method such as risk modelling (Monte-Carlo, Statistics, etc.)

## Risk Evaluation

A key concept to assist in risk analysis is that the size of each risk is
  directly proportional to two key driving factors.

* **Likelihood**. Chance of risk event, for example 10% chance annually

* **Consequence**. Realised losses, for example £1k-£2k fine depending on
  impact to surrounding areas.

$$
    \text{Risk}
        = \text{Likelihood} \times \text{Consequence}
$$

Other words may be used in place of these (for example, likelihood can also be
  *"failure frequency"* or "*probability*"; consequence may be *"severity"*)
  but the concept remains fixed.
  
Using the examples above, the upper bound is
$$
    \text{Risk}
        = 0.1 \times £2k = £200 \text{ per year.}
$$
Calculating cost per year, in monetary terms, can be extremely useful as it
  provides us with an interpretable measure that can be compared across the
  business.

This ensures we don't overspend resource thinking about catastrophic failures
  that are $1$ in $10^9$ events and similarly we don't spend too long
  with the risk of losing a highly available cheap component when the
  consequence is trivial.
  
More quantitative approaches exist and they may even consider likelihood before
  and after mitigation.
With such approaches it is not uncommon to see a risk matrix as the one shown
  in @fig-risk_matrix.
