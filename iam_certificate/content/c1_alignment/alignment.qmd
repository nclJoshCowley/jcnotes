# Alignment

## Principle of Alignment

![Principle of Alignment (Draw.IO)](../../images/principle_of_alignment.drawio.svg){#fig-alignment}

@fig-alignment shows a crudely drawn oversimplification of what we mean by
  alignment. A more complete version is available in ISO 55000.
One can see that all objectives flow down from *top management* by defining

* **AM Policy**. Short document covering key priorities of AM
  ([AM Policy](ampolicy.html))

* **SAMP**. Strategic AM plan with long-term goals considered
  ([SAMP](samp.html))

* **AMP**. AM plan for the immediate activities over a pre-defined period of
  time

All of these create a feedback loop with the original organisational long-term
  objectives.

## Asset Manager Role

Note that it is not for the asset manager to decide organisational objectives
  such as which stakeholders to priorities or how far to meet stakeholder
  demands.

Instead, the role involves understanding how to best meet these demands and
  objectives within a always-changing environment.
