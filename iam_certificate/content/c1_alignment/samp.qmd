Recall from @fig-6box that the SAMP is informed by the organisational
  objectives directly and the AM policy document.
It also informs the AM plan.

The document includes

* Strategies for assets

* Strategies for enablers (risk management, asset information, etc.)

* Objectives for each strategy

These strategies may apply to specific asset classes, specific service lines,
  sites or systems.
