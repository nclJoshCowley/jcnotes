# Introduction

## What is Asset Management?

Before we can manage assets, we must define what is or isn't an asset.

## Definition
An **asset** is an entity owned by a person or company that has value,
  or potential to have value.

While all companies must manage assets in some capacity, **Asset Management**
  is the formalisation of several techniques.
Similarly, it may be the case that only some assets are formally managed in
  this way and are referred to collectively as the *asset portfolio*.

  stage (**continued improvement**)
