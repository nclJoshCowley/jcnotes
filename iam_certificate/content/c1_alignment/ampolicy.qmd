# AM Policy

The Asset Management Policy (AM Policy) is a short document (fewer than 5
  pages) that will describe the principles and overall approach guiding the
  AM activities.
Hence, such a document is a commitment from *top management* that is
  accompanied by further commitments to continual improvement and periodic
  review.

## Maturity

We assess the maturity of an asset management department using GFMAM Landscape
  Subjects.
These can be found directly from GFMAM, or in the [IAM Anatomy][iam_anatomy]
  document and associated @fig-subjects
  
![GFMAM Landscape Subjects](../../images/gfmam_subjects.png){#fig-subjects}

Note that these are coloured with the 10-box colour model and not the 6-box
  conceptual model shown in @fig-6box.
  
For maturiy, each subject is quantified on a 5-point scale,

* **0: Incompetent**

* **1: Aware**

* **2: Developing**

* **3: Competent**

* **4: Effective**

* **5: Excellent**

Note that maturity of each subject can decline if neglected and the ultimate
  goal is to not have maximum scores in all subjects as this is likely
  short-lived, difficult to maintain and not cost effective.
