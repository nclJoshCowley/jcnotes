## Introduction

We cover each of the already mentioned shared responsibility models.

![Diagram showing the responsibilities of the shared responsibility model.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/wwl-azure/describe-cloud-compute/media/shared-responsibility-b3829bfe.svg){#fig-shared-responsibility-model}


## Describe Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

The most flexible option, IaaS, allows for the most control over resources.
A entity providing IaaS is responsible for hardware maintenance, physical
    security and internet connectivity.
All configurations are the responsibility of the customer including operating
    systems and database configuration to mention a few.

Such a system may make the most sense when existing infrastructure, such as 
    on-premises resources or knowledgeable staff, already exist and require
    scaling.


## Describe Platform as a Service (PaaS)

When a cloud provider is also in charge of operating systems,
    database configurations and potentially network security, this can be more
    aptly described as PaaS.

These agreements are more common in development frameworks where developers
    within the customer entity may modify or extend existing cloud-based
    solutions.


## Describe Software as a Service (SaaS)

The most complete product, SaaS. places the most responsibility on the cloud
    provider.
Email is a good example as the technical details such as where and how to store
    messages are covered by the vendor.
