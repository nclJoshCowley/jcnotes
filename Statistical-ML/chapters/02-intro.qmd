## Motivation

Both statistics and machine learning (ML) are closely related and yet have 
distinct differences. 

These notes consider ML to be a set of methods, often involving algorithmic
black-box techniques that are primarily focused on the task of prediction.
Whereas statistics is broader and can focus on other concepts such as parameter
estimation and explanatory modelling.
