    "text": "High Availability and Scalability\nAvailability can be defined in terms of uptime, when the sever is available for use, and downtime, not available for use due to maintenance, repairs or upgrades. Many obligations from providers vary between 99% and 99.9% availability, depending on business requirements. Such agreements are laid out in service level agreements (SLAs).\nScalability is the ability to handle surge demand, where traffic will peak for a short time and reduce back to background level after some time. This can be done in two ways\n\nVertical: improving current resources such as CPU compute or RAM,\nHorizontal: including more machines to handle more compute.\n\nHorizontal scaling is made easier with on-demand cloud computing."

    "text": "Reliability and Predictability\nReliability, defined as the ability to recover from failures, is a requirement for many frameworks. Decentralised computing offered by cloud services allows for higher resilience from regional catastrophic events.\nWhen using an on-demand service, predictable performance and costs are heavily desired. By deploying to the cloud, with solutions including autoscaling and monitoring, one has a better idea for performance that may impact user experience. Similarly, cost is more predictable thanks to analytics and consistent environments (no paying for a Windows upgrade or stray process)."
