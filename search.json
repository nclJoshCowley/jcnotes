    "text": "Financial Appraisal\nThere are several methods to determine if benefits outweigh costs financially. We focus on Net Present Value (NPV).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nNet Present Value (NPV) is the sum of the Present Value over all years considered.\nPresent Value are the future cash flows, adjusted for some known rate. That is, \\[\n    \\text{Present Value}\n        = \\frac{\\text{Future Value}}{(1 + i)^n}\n\\]\n\n\nThis rate is typically set by the finance department that are more aware of financial trends both internal and external to the organisation.\nThe main takeaway is that\n\n\\(\\text{NPV} &gt; 0 \\implies \\text{Profitable}\\)\n\\(\\text{NPV} = 0 \\implies \\text{Break-even}\\)\n\\(\\text{NPV} &lt; 0 \\implies \\text{Not Profitable}\\)\n\n\nWorked Example\nSuppose we are only considering value lost to inflation, future value is the amount we are expecting at time of agreement\n\nI will pay you £5 in 5 years from today, but it will cost you £4\n\n\\(FV = £5\\)\n\nInflation is set at \\(5\\%\\)\n\n\\((1 + i)^5 = 1.05^5\\)\n\nPresent value is therefore\n\n\\(\\frac{£5}{1.05^5} \\approx £3.92\\)\n\n\nAccepting this scenario for the up-front cost of \\(£4\\) would result in a losing scenario. Note that the naive approach (that \\(£5 &gt; £4\\)) would simply accept and ignore the inflationary rate.\n\n\nPayback Period\nThis toy example does not consider the typical cash-flow of an investment. In reality, we spend a large amount of money (capital) and recuperate those losses over time with revenue.\nThus, we can determine the amount of time required to get our money back on the initial investment.\n\nWhen the discount rate is ignored, this is the payback period\n\nFor example, £1M investment creating £100k annually takes 10 years to pay back\n\nAdjusting for the discount rate leads to the (typically longer) discounted payback period.\n\nAgain, £1M investment creating £100k annually takes longer than 10 years when “adjusting” for the rate",
